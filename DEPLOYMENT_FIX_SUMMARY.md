# Cloudflare Pages Data Loading Fix

## Issue Fixed
The deployed website at https://aigame.lol was showing "数据加载失败: Failed to fetch games: 404" because the frontend was trying to call API endpoints that don't exist in the Cloudflare Pages environment.

## Root Cause
The environment detection logic in both `dataConfig.ts` and `useSupabaseData.ts` was only checking for `velist.github.io` as the production hostname, but not recognizing `aigame.lol` as a production environment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Environment Detection in `src/lib/dataConfig.ts`
- Added `aigame.lol` to the production hostname detection
- Updated base URL logic to handle Cloudflare Pages (no base path) vs GitHub Pages (with `/warp-zone-gems` base path)
- Added debug logging for troubleshooting

### 2. Fixed Environment Detection in `src/hooks/useSupabaseData.ts`  
- Added `aigame.lol` to the production hostname detection
- Updated path configuration for Cloudflare Pages deployment
- Added enhanced debug logging

### 3. Build Configuration
- Verified that static JSON files in `public/data/` are properly copied to `dist/data/` during build
- Confirmed `_redirects` file is properly configured for Cloudflare Pages

## Data Files Structure
The following static JSON files are available at the root of the deployment:
- `/data/games.json` - Contains 24 games with full metadata
- `/data/categories.json` - Contains game categories
- `/data/banners.json` - Banner configurations
- `/data/popups.json` - Popup configurations
- `/data/floating-windows.json` - Floating window configurations

## Environment Detection Logic
```javascript
const isProduction = window.location.hostname === 'velist.github.io' || 
                    window.location.hostname === 'aigame.lol' ||
                    window.location.protocol === 'https:' ||
                    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

const isCloudflarePages = window.location.hostname === 'aigame.lol';
const basePath = isCloudflarePages ? '' : '/warp-zone-gems';
```

## Deployment Steps
1. Run `npm run build` to create production build
2. The `dist/` folder contains all necessary files including static JSON data
3. Deploy the `dist/` folder contents to Cloudflare Pages
4. The app will automatically detect the `aigame.lol` hostname and use static JSON files

## Verification
- Built app successfully with Vite
- Verified static JSON files are accessible via HTTP
- Confirmed data structure matches expected format
- Tested environment detection logic

The fix ensures that when deployed to Cloudflare Pages at aigame.lol, the app will:
1. Correctly identify itself as running in production
2. Use the static JSON files at `/data/*.json` instead of trying to call API endpoints
3. Load game and category data without 404 errors
